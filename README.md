# Acceptance Criteria
* on the start page there is a button
* clicking this button should open a modal
* data should be fetched when the modal is opened

(fetch data from https://random-data-
api.com/api/users/random_user?size={size})

* during the fetch request display a simple loading
state (text is ok)
* in the modal window display the "profile" of a
selected user, consisting of avatar, full name and email
* in the modal window it is possible to configure the
amount of users to be fetched via a text input
* in the modal window it is possible to fetch another
set of users by pressing a button
* when asking for more than 20 users an error should
be displayed and the fetch should not start
* in the dialog there is a close button, if the dialog is
re-opened the same set of users is visible
* only fetch if the dialog is opened for the first time, or
the next-button is clicked
* add the possibility to switch between the users using
a toggle bar
* clicking a button on bar displays the appropriate
profile
# Nice to have:
* the toggle bar should have multiple rows
* each row should have up to 5 buttons
* all rows except the last one should have the same
amount of buttons
* please develop a simple algorithm so that the last
row should have the largest number of buttons
possible while having at most as many as the rows
above (.e. 10 items => 5 5, 11 items => 4 4 3, 12 items
=> 4 4 4, 13 items => 5 5 3, 14 items => 5 5 4 â€“ see
screenshots provided)
* The multi-row bar should have rounded corners on
each row in the first and last buttons
